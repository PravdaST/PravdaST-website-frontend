Using the REST API

[Get Started](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome) [Endpoints](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/access-groups/reads-an-access-group)

To view all endpoints, and explore code examples with the SDK and direct API calls, see the [reference endpoints documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints).

You can deploy new versions of web applications, manage custom domains, retrieve information about deployments, and manage secrets and environment variables for projects.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP requests.

To interact with the API, you can:

- [Use the Vercel SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/sdk) by first instantiating with your token
- Use the language of your choice by calling the endpoints directly and [providing your token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference#authentication)

## [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#api-basics)  API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under the URL [https://api.vercel.com](https://api.vercel.com/) and then generally follow the REST architecture.

### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#server-specs)  Server Specs

#### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#http-and-tls)  HTTP and TLS

The API supports HTTP versions 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred.

TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported, with resumption.

For more information on TLS support, refer to the SSL Labs report.

### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#content-type)  Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: application/json header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Vercel API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#authentication)  Authentication

Vercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel API.

```
  Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>

```

#### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#creating-an-access-token)  Creating an Access Token

Access Tokens can be created and managed from inside your [account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).

1. In the upper-right corner of your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), click your profile picture, then select **Settings**
2. Select **Tokens** from the sidebar
3. Enter a descriptive name for the token
4. Choose the scope from the list of Teams in the drop-down menu. The scope ensures that only your specified Team(s) can use an Access Token
5. From the drop-down, select an expiration date for the Token
6. Click **Create Token**
7. Once you’ve created an Access Token, securely store the value as it will not be shown again.

#### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#expiration)  Expiration

Setting an expiration date on an Access Token is highly recommended and is considered one of the standard security practices that helps keep your information secure. You can select from a default list of expiration dates ranging from 1 day to 1 year. You can view the expiration date of your Access Tokens on the [tokens page.](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

#### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#accessing-resources-owned-by-a-team)  Accessing Resources Owned by a Team

By default, you can access resources contained within your own user account (personal).

To access resources owned by a team, or create a project for a _specific_ team, you must first find the [Team ID](https://vercel.com/docs/teams-and-accounts/create-or-join-a-team#find-your-team-id).

After you obtained the Team ID, append it as a query string at the end of the API endpoint URL:

Copy

```
https://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?teamId=[teamID]

```

#### [​](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference\#failed-authentication)  Failed Authentication

If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the [error status code](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference#errors) **403** is returned.
