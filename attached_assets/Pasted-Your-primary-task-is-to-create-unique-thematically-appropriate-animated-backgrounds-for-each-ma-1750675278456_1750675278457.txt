Your primary task is to create unique, thematically appropriate **animated backgrounds** for each main service page: `/services/seo-struktor`, `/services/sales-engine`, and `/services/clientomat`.

The new style should be inspired by the existing animated background on the homepage, which uses a tech-grid and constantly moving lines. Do not use a scroll-based parallax effect.

Please follow these steps:

**1. Analysis & Inspiration:**
First, analyze the existing CSS and HTML structure for the hero section on the homepage to understand how the `.tech-grid-bg` and `.tech-lines` animations are built. Use this as a technical foundation. Then, visit each service page to understand its specific theme.

**2. Creative Implementation:**
For each service, create a new, self-contained React component (e.g., `SeoStruktorBackground.jsx`) with its own CSS for the animations. The animations should be continuous and subtle.

Here are the creative directions for each service's animated background:

* **For "SEO Struktor" (Theme: Structure, Data, Architecture):**
    * **Static Layer:** A faint blueprint grid, similar to the homepage.
    * **Animated Elements:** Instead of just horizontal lines, animate slowly moving, interconnected nodes and thin lines that form simple, abstract network structures or graphs. The movement should be slow and deliberate.

* **For "Sales Engine" (Theme: Process, Growth, Funnels):**
    * **Static Layer:** A subtle, clean gradient background.
    * **Animated Elements:** Animate slowly rotating, outlined gears and cogs at different depths (using different `opacity` and `z-index`). Additionally, create an effect of small, glowing particles flowing slowly upwards from the bottom of the screen, representing a sales funnel.

* **For "Clientomat" (Theme: Automation, Flow, Efficiency):**
    * **Static Layer:** A clean, dark background.
    * **Animated Elements:** Animate smooth, curved lines (like data streams) flowing across the screen from one side to the other. You can add small, gently pulsing circles that travel along these lines, representing automated tasks being completed.

**3. Integration:**
Place each new background component inside the main hero section of its corresponding service page. Ensure it is positioned absolutely behind the main text content and does not interfere with readability or user interaction.

**4. Final Commit:**
Commit the new components and CSS changes with a descriptive message like "feat: Add custom animated backgrounds for service pages".
