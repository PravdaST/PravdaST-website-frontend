Your task is to integrate Google Analytics 4 (GA4) into this Vite + React project. The implementation must be secure, using environment variables, and it must correctly track pageviews in this Single Page Application (SPA).

Please follow these steps exactly:

1.  **Install Package:** Install the `react-ga4` package.

2.  **Configure Local Environment Variable:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root if one doesn't already exist.
    * Add the following line to the `.env` file. Use this exact placeholder value; do not use a real key.
        `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`

3.  **Ensure Git Ignores Environment File:**
    * Open the `.gitignore` file.
    * Add a new line with `.env` at the end of the file if it's not already there. This is critical for security.

4.  **Initialize GA4 in the Application:**
    * Modify the application's main entry point, `src/main.jsx`, to initialize `react-ga4`. It should only initialize if the environment variable is present.

5.  **Implement SPA Pageview Tracking:**
    * To track navigation within the app, create a new custom React Hook. Create a new directory `src/hooks` if it doesn't exist.
    * Inside that directory, create a new file named `usePageTracking.js` with the following content. This hook will use `react-router-dom` to send a pageview event on every route change.

    ```javascript
    // src/hooks/usePageTracking.js
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
    import ReactGA from 'react-ga4';

    const usePageTracking = () => {
      const location = useLocation();
      const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);

      useEffect(() => {
        if (import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID) {
          ReactGA.initialize(import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID);
          setInitialized(true);
        }
      }, []);

      useEffect(() => {
        if (initialized) {
          ReactGA.send({ hitType: "pageview", page: location.pathname + location.search });
        }
      }, [initialized, location]);
    };

    export default usePageTracking;
    ```

6.  **Activate Page Tracking:**
    * Now, use this new hook in the main `App.jsx` component to activate the tracking. Make sure it's placed inside the Router component.

    ```javascript
    // In src/App.jsx
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
    import usePageTracking from './hooks/usePageTracking'; // Import the hook
    // ... import your other components

    function App() {
      usePageTracking(); // Activate page tracking here

      return (
        <Router>
          {/* ... your header, footer, and <Routes> component ... */}
        </Router>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

7.  **Final Confirmation:** After completing these steps, please confirm that the integration is complete and all specified files have been created or modified correctly.
